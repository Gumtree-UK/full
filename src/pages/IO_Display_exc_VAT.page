<b><br/>Standard Advertising Terms and Conditions<br></b></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" font size="1">
<b><u>1</u></b> Provided that Advertiser is in compliance with the provisions of this agreement, Gumtree.com Ltd. ("Gumtree") shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the impressions set out on the Order Form but cannot warrant (i) the number of visitors to the Advertiser's site as a result, or (ii) the exact times at which the impressions will be delivered. Furthermore the precise quantities per placement are not guaranteed and over delivery of impressions of certain placements may be applied toward a deficit of other placements in order to attain the impressions set out on the Order Form. If Gumtree does not deliver the impressions set out on the Order Form in any month, Gumtree may over deliver impressions of certain placements in subsequent months in order to attain the aggregate impressions set out on the Order Form applicable for the Term. At the expiry of the Term, Gumtree shall not be obliged to deliver any further impressions regardless of actual delivery. The Advertiser shall deliver to Gumtree such technical and other materials as Gumtree may reasonably require from the Advertiser from time to time. 
<br/><br/>
<b><u>2</u></b> Once the Order Form is signed, it may not be cancelled except with the written consent of Gumtree subject to either party's right to terminate in clause 18. If cancellation is consented to, the Advertiser will be immediately liable to pay for all services then delivered and a cancellation fee equal to either (i) 50% of the cost of the impressions and the tenancy fee (if applicable) for the term of the agreement (or any remainder of such a period), or (ii) in the event no end date is specified 50% of the impressions to be delivered or the tenancy fee (if applicable) during the first three months of the agreement as specified on the Order Form.  Such a cancellation fee will be fully redeemable against any further order of impressions accepted by Gumtree within 6 months of the date of this agreement.

<b><u>3</u></b> Gumtree shall have the option to publish the advertisement, if the advertisement copy is supplied by Advertiser to Gumtree after the Publication Deadline.

The agent shall be solely responsible for making the Advertiser aware of this agreement or any subsequent amendments that may be agreed by the parties.
<br/><br/>
<b><u>14</u></b> In the event that the Order Form contains details of a CPA arrangement between the parties, Advertiser shall (a) for the duration of the agreement track the number of click throughs and impressions delivered by it as well as the number of acquisitions concluded on the Advertiser's website by Gumtree users and shall (b) on a monthly basis provide Gumtree accurate evidence of the same.

The invoice(s) shall relate to the impressions and services delivered up to the date indicated, the charges for which shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis.  Gumtree's statistics on click-through rates and impressions shall be the only statistics relevant for the calculation of any amounts due under this agreement.  Gumtree shall keep separate records of statistics relevant for the calculation of any amounts due under this agreement. For the purpose of confirming the accuracy of the statistics, Advertiser will have the right to appoint an independent third party auditor from a recognised firm of accountants to audit and inspect copies of all such statistics, provided that Advertiser gives Gumtree at least 10 days' prior written notice. Any information revealed during such audits shall be deemed to be confidential. In the event that any audit reveals an under delivery of ten percent or more of the impressions to be delivered by Gumtree set out on the Order Form, Gumtree will over deliver impressions after expiry of the Term in order to attain the aggregate impressions set out on the Order Form applicable for the Term, in accordance with Clause 1. All payment shall be made in the currency as specified and used in the invoice.

Gumtree shall have the right to audit Advertiser's accounts and records as detailed in this clause 16.

<br/><br/>
<b><u>20</u></b> If any provision of this agreement is held by a court or other competent authority to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part the validity of the other provisions of the agreement and the remainder of the provision in question shall not be affected.  No failure or delay by Gumtree in exercising any of its right shall be deemed a waiver of that right, and no waiver by Gumtree of any breach of the agreement by the Advertiser shall be considered a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision.
