                <b>Vendor Agreement Terms & Conditions</b><br/>
                <b>1. Voucher Program</b><br/>
                    1.1 <i>Voucher Sale.</i> Vendor authorizes Gumtree Daily Deals to offer, sell and distribute the Voucher (including through the Gumtree Contractor) on Vendor's behalf, as Vendor's agent, in accordance with this Agreement. Vouchers are offered on the Gumtree website by Vendor and the sale of Vouchers is between Vendor and purchasers and not Gumtree Daily Deals.  Vendor acknowledges that Gumtree Daily Deals may terminate the publication or promotion of the Voucher at any time without liability to Vendor or customers of Vendor. <br/>
                    1.2 <i>Voucher Publication and Delivery.</i> Vouchers shall be published on the Website in accordance with this Agreement and in accordance with the general Website terms and conditions. The date (the "Release Date") on which Gumtree Daily Deals publishes the Voucher and offers it to its users will be determined by Gumtree Daily Deals. The Voucher shall be activated, which means capable of being used for purchases from the Vendor in accordance with the Voucher Terms and Conditions, only when the certain Deal Unlock Quantity has been met (the "Activation Date"). At the time that the Deal Unlock Quantity has been met, Gumtree Daily Deals will cause the electronic delivery of the Voucher to the customer.  Customer shall have seven (7) days, from when Gumtree Daily Deals deliver the Voucher, to cancel such Voucher for a full refund.  Once a Voucher is activated and delivered to the customer, Vendor shall be solely responsible for all customer service in connection with the Voucher and goods or services associated with the Voucher.  Vendor shall provide a customer service contact to assist in resolving customer disputes or addressing customer questions or problems relating to the Vouchers.  The Vendor agrees to hold harmless, indemnify and defend Gumtree Daily Deals and its affiliates against any complaints, claims, or liabilities arising from the customers of Vendor relating to the delivery or acceptance of a Voucher and/or arising from the goods and services and redemption of a Voucher.<br/>
                    1.3 <i>Payment.</i> Gumtree Daily Deals will remit the amount due to the Vendor no more than twenty one (21) days after the Activation Date (if any).  If a Voucher has no activation then no monies are due to Vendor.  The amount due shall reflect the number of Vouchers sold at the Activation Date minus any Vouchers cancelled in accordance with clause 1.2 above.  Amounts retained (as set out in the Vendor Agreement) by Gumtree Daily Deals under this Agreement represent payment to Gumtree Daily Deals (inclusive of VAT) for the service of advertising and selling the Voucher on behalf of the Vendor.  The parties agree that all accounting calculations will be based on Gumtree Daily Deals' then-current accounting and database system, which will be presumed to be accurate and complete.  The parties further agree to work together in good faith to reconcile any accounting discrepancies.  Gumtree shall provide Vendor with a remittance setting out the number of Vouchers sold for each deal and a VAT invoice, marked paid, setting out the amount retained by Gumtree for payment plus VAT.<br/>
                <b>2. Term and Termination</b><br/>
                    This Agreement shall continue in effect for the longer of one (1) year following the Effective Date or the last date when a customer of Gumtree Daily Deals redeems a Voucher offered by Vendor from Gumtree Daily Deals.  Gumtree Daily Deals may terminate this Agreement by giving the Vendor written notice of such termination.  The expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not in any way affect the customers' usage of the Voucher or the Vendor's obligation for redemption of the Voucher.<br/>
                <b>3. Vendor Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Indemnification.</b><br/>
                    Vendor represents, warrants and covenants throughout the term of this Agreement that (a) Vendor has the power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to grant the rights granted herein and to perform its obligations hereunder; (b) upon Vouchers being activated and delivered by Gumtree Daily Deals, the associated goods and/or services shall be available immediately for redemption by customer; (c) each of the participating Vendor Stores will redeem the Vouchers;  (d) the Voucher Terms and Conditions comply with applicable law; (e) Vendor has the resource and capability to redeem, provide and properly perform the delivery of all goods and services associated with all Vouchers sold; and (f) Vendor complies, and will cause the participating Vendor Stores to comply, with the Vendor Terms and Conditions and applicable law and regulations.<br/>           
                    Vendor further agrees to comply with then-current terms of use and privacy policy applicable to the Website. Vendor is responsible for all applicable VAT due on the redemption of its Voucher. Vendor shall pay any monies owed to any party, as well as all legal fees related to any action against, or determinations against, Gumtree Daily Deals related to any action to pursue Gumtree Daily Deals for payment of any taxes. Vendor acknowledges that Gumtree Daily Deals is relying on the information provided, including, without limitation, any trademark protected, copyright protected,              or other protected information, and financial information, by the Vendor and Vendor agrees to indemnify and hold Gumtree Daily Deals and its affiliates harmless against any damages, complaints, actions, or any other liabilities arising from Gumtree Daily Deals' or the Gumtree Contractor's use of or reliance upon Vendor-provided information in producing and selling the Vouchers.

                <b>5. Data Protection</b><br/>
                   The parties acknowledge and agree that Gumtree Daily Deals will not share any information regarding Gumtree Daily Deals users with Vendor, other than information regarding Gumtree Daily Deals' users that Vendor requires in order to fulfill orders placed for Vouchers by Gumtree Daily Deals' users.  Subject to the foregoing, in Vendor's capacity selling Vouchers, Vendor may receive personally identifiable information regarding Gumtree Daily Deals' users ("User Data").
