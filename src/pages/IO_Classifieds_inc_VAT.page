<b><u>12 General</u></b> 12.1 If a party is prevented from performing any or all of its obligations of this Agreement by any act, event, omission or condition beyond a party's control (a "Force Majeure Event"), the affected party shall give written notice to the other party within two (2) business days of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event and the affected party shall be excused from such performance during, but not longer than, the continuance of such Force Majeure Event.  Each party shall bear their own costs arising from the Force Majeure Event and shall take all reasonable steps to find ways to perform their obligations despite the Force Majeure Event.  If the Force Majeure Event continues for more than thirty (30) consecutive days, the other party may immediately terminate this Agreement on giving written notice to the affected party. 12.2 This Agreement (including any documents referred to) (the "<b>Contractual Documents</b>") contains the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter covered in the Contractual Documents and supersedes any previous agreements, arrangements, undertakings, negotiations, discussions or proposals, written or oral, between the parties in relation to such matters.  No oral explanation or oral information given by any party shall alter the interpretation of the Contractual Documents. Each party confirms that, in agreeing to enter into the Contractual Documents, it has not relied on any statement, representation, warranty, understanding, undertaking, promise or assurance (whether negligently or innocently made) of any person save insofar as the same has expressly been made in the Contractual Documents and agrees that it shall have no remedy in respect of any misrepresentation which has not become a term of the Contractual Documents except that this Clause shall not apply in respect of any fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation whether or not such has become a term of the Contractual Documents. 12.3 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a partnership or joint venture of any kind between the parties or as constituting or authorising either party as the agent of the other party for any purpose whatsoever. Neither party shall have the authority or power to bind the other, or to contract in the name of, or hold itself out as, or create a liability against the other in any way or for any purpose. 12.4 Neither party shall assign (including by way of a charge or declaration of trust) sub-license or deal in any way with this Agreement or any of its rights under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that each party shall have the right to assign this Agreement to a subsidiary, holding or parent company (and any of their subsidiaries) of that party on prior written notice to the other party. 12.5 Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, a person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right to rely upon or enforce any term of this Agreement. 12.6 The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement (and any claim, dispute or matter arising under or in connection with it or its enforceability) shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. Each party irrevocably agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts over any claim, dispute or matter arising under or in connection with this Agreement or its enforceability or the legal relationships established by this Agreement. 12.7 Neither party shall advertise or publicly announce, communicate or circulate the existence or terms of this Agreement or any association with the other party without the prior written consent of the other party. 12.8 Any notice given under this Agreement shall be in writing in English and served by hand, fax, prepaid recorded or special delivery post or prepaid international recorded airmail. In the case of Gumtree, notices shall be given to its Financial Director at the address specified in the Agreement.  In the case of Company, notice shall be sent to the address referred to in this Agreement. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been served at the time of delivery.  The parties shall notify each other of changes in addresses for service during the Term of this Agreement. 12.9 If any clause of this Agreement is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect. 12.10 The failure to exercise or delay in exercising a right or remedy under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of the right or remedy or a waiver of any other rights or remedies and no single or partial exercise of any right or remedy under this Agreement shall prevent any further exercise of the right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy.  The rights and remedies contained in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. 12.11 No modification or variation of this Agreement shall be valid if made by email and shall otherwise only be valid if in writing and signed for or on behalf of each of the parties.  12.12 Company shall execute or cause to be executed all such other documents and do or cause to be done all such further acts and things (consistent with the terms of this Agreement) as Gumtree may from time to time reasonably require. 12.13 This Agreement may be signed in duplicate, each of which, when signed, shall be original, and all the duplicates together shall constitute the same Agreement.
